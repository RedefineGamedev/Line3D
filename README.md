# How to Install

 1. Clone or download the zip from the repository
 2. Create an **addons** folder in your Godot Project
 3. Put the folder Line3D in the addons folder (its contents should be the files from the repo)
 4. Go in Project / Project Settings / Plugins
 5. Enable the plugin (if you don't see it, restart the engine)

# How to Use

After installing the plugin, you can create a new node called Line3D. It has similar features to Line2D.
In order for the Line3D to display correctly, you must have a Camera node in the scene.

# How to Contribute

 1. Follow the [gdscript style guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html)
 2. After you fix the issue or add a new feature, create a pull request
 3. Try to maintain a 1:1 compatibility with Line2D (when the same feature is present in both)
